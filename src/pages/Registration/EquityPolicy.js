            <p>
                The Habib University Model United Nations (hereinafter referred to as HUMUN) was
                founded on the principle of respect for diversity and the necessity of preparing our
                future leaders for success in an increasingly globalized world. Through preparation
                for and participation in HUMUN, students gain an understanding of the complex
                realities and challenges facing the international community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, its success is both defined and enhanced by the diversity of participant
                backgrounds it attracts. The cultural, ethnic, racial, and religious diversity of
                HUMUN participants is what makes this program unique and indispensable. Thus, all
                HUMUN participants, including delegates, staff, and guests are expected to follow a
                mature, professional, and respectful code of conduct at all times to ensure and
                maintain an inclusive, respectful, and safe environment for both members and
                participants alike. It is required that each individual reads, understands, and
                abides by the Equity Policy outlined below.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having said that, terminologies used within the Policy are first defined to ensure
                clarity of understanding and effective implementation of the Equity Policy by all
                individuals involved in the event in any capacity as follows:

                        Equity Policy: A conclusive and holistic framework adopted by HUMUN to
                        ensure the equal, fair, just, and safe contribution of all the HUMUN
                        participants regardless of their race, class, gender identity, gender, sex,
                        sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, etc.

                        Direct sexual harassment: A type of behaviour that is characterised by
                        unwanted or non-consensual sexual advances, physical contact, and any
                        unwelcome sexual physical or verbal conduct.

                    <p>
                        Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment: A type of unwanted sexual contact when a
                        person of authority coerces their (junior) peers for (non-consensual) sexual
                        favours in exchange for a particular benefit like committee award,
                        unwarranted guidance, and any leverage. Such behaviour is also characterised
                        by the decisions that person(s) of authority make based on accepting or
                        rejecting the demands for (non-consensual) sexual favours. For example:
                        revoking the award eligibility of person X based on the rejection of sexual
                        favour Y by the person(s) of authority Z.{' '}

                        Hostile Work Environment: An environment characterised by fear and
                        intimidation subjected to a HUMUN participant X by the person(s) of
                        authority or peers based on X's sex, gender, gender identity or expression,
                        sexual orientation, and other protected attributes. Such an environment
                        directly and adversely affects X's ability to do their work. A hostile work
                        environment also arises when individuals refuse to submit to unwelcome
                        sexual advances and are subjected to threats, unfair treatment, and other
                        sources of intimidation.
